          </h1>
           <p class="lead my-6 text-muted">Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from Ghana. The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person.</p>

           <p class="lead my-6 text-muted"> According to Akan tradition, each child is born with a name associated to their soul. The day the child is born is therefore determined by the soul. The well thought and organized naming system of the Akan’s was initiated by the ancestors and has attracted so many people’s attention as they desire to know more about these names.</p>

           <p class="lead my-6 text-muted">Akan names are not just names given to children to give them identity. There is a specific traditional system that is followed when the naming is being done. The names also have different meanings and appellations.</p>

           <p class="lead my-6 text-muted"> Ever wondered what the Akan names mean?</p>
           <p class="lead my-6 text-muted"> Fill in your details here <a href= "#form">here</a> to find out more about your Akan name and appellations.</p>
